      <h1>My Background :</h1>
      <h2>As an artist, I create short films and video games. Since my childhood I have always had the curiosity to learn how to make good movies and video games that I play and do all the creative stuff on the computer. I remember when I was 9 years old, I got my first computer as a gift from my parents. It's true that I was so excited for it but to be honest, back then I had no idea how to use a computer. I choose to learn about computers on my own and since then, I have been trying to learn new things on my computer every single day.

One memory that I have in my mind when I use Photoshop on my computer for the first time to edit my own picture. I cropped my favorite superhero Spider-man's face and added my face on Spider-man's body. This was my first creative work on my own as a kid. It took me all day to figure out how to do this editing properly. This experience teaches me that if you have the desire to learn something creative, you must try on your own first. So, I can admit that my childhood curiosity and experience became my major influence to work on short films and video games.

â€‹

I also believe that doing proper research and taking essential academic courses are the plus points for enhancing the creative skills. Currently, I am studying Energing Media Technology at City Tech. I believe, this course and all the creative stuff that I am learning in my academic career are going to enhance my creative skills and will be playing a major part in my professional career.</h2>
